Just trying out socket.io

cd on the messageapp then run the command `yarn start`

open another terminal tab then cd on the backend then run the command `npm run server` or `npm run start`

then have two tabs running localhost:3000

server will automatically console.log how many sockets are connected in the web socket server!
